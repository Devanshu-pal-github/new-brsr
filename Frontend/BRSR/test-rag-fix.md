# RAG Table Mapping Fix Test

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Critical Error Fix**: `Cannot assign to read only property '0' of object '[object Array]'`
   - Fixed by properly deep cloning the data structure instead of shallow copying
   - Now uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for complete cloning

2. **Console Log Spam**: Removed infinite re-rendering console logs
   - Removed repetitive logs from QuestionRagModal, DynamicQuestionRenderer, and RagDocumentQA
   - Kept only essential RAG mapping logs for debugging

3. **Re-rendering Optimization**: Memoized question object to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Added `useMemo` to stabilize question props
   - This should prevent the modal from re-rendering repeatedly

## What to Test:

1. Open the Edit Modal for a table question
2. Open RAG modal and upload a document
3. Click "Use All Values" or "Use Selected Values"
4. Verify that ALL rows (PF, Gratuity, ESI, Others) are updated with values, not just Gratuity
5. Check that console logs are clean without excessive repetition
6. Verify that the values are properly saved when submitting the form

## Expected Behavior:

- No more "Cannot assign to read only property" errors
- All table rows should be updated with RAG values
- Console logs should be minimal and relevant
- RAG mapping should work for both PF and other rows

## Debug Info:

Look for these console logs to verify the fix:
- `üîç [RAG] Received RAG table values:` - Shows what backend sent
- `üîç [RAG] Updated cell [X][Y] = "value"` - Shows each cell update
- `üîç [RAG] Updated N cells total` - Shows total updated cells
- `üîç [RAG] Final mapping complete - updated data:` - Shows final structure

If you still see issues, the debug logs will help identify the exact problem.
